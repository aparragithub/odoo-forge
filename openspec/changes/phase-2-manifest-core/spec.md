# Spec: Phase 2 Slice 1 — Manifest Core

## Purpose

Pure Pydantic v2 domain for `project.yaml`/`project.lock`, onion composition,
drift detection, and a thin `forge validate` CLI. No git/docker/network.

## Capability: manifest-schema (New)

### Requirement: Core layer is a first-class field

`Manifest.core` MUST be a required `CoreLayer` with `type: Literal["core"]`,
`url: str = "https://github.com/odoo/odoo.git"`, `ref: str | None = None`.
When `ref` is `None`, composition MUST resolve it to the `odoo_version` branch
name; the field itself MUST NOT duplicate `factory/versions.yaml`.

#### Scenario: Default core ref
- GIVEN a manifest with `odoo_version: "19.0"` and no `core.ref`
- WHEN the manifest is composed
- THEN the resolved core ref is `"19.0"`

#### Scenario: Overridden core url
- GIVEN a manifest with `core.url` set to a fork
- WHEN the manifest is parsed
- THEN the schema accepts the override and stores no resolved SHA (intent only)

### Requirement: Per-artifact edition gating

`GitRepo` and every `Layer` variant MUST expose an optional
`requires_edition: Literal["enterprise"] | None = None`. Coherence validation
MUST reject any `edition == "community"` manifest containing a repo or layer,
at any nesting depth, with `requires_edition == "enterprise"`.

#### Scenario: Enterprise repo nested in localization rejected
- GIVEN a community manifest whose `localization` `GitLayer` contains a repo
  `odoo-argentina-ee` with `requires_edition: "enterprise"`
- WHEN the manifest is composed
- THEN composition MUST raise a `CompositionError` naming the offending repo

#### Scenario: Enterprise manifest accepts the same repo
- GIVEN the same repo inside an `edition: "enterprise"` manifest
- WHEN the manifest is composed
- THEN composition succeeds

### Requirement: Explicit discriminated layer union

`Layer` MUST be `Annotated[PublishedLayer | GitLayer, Field(discriminator="type")]`,
each member carrying its own `type: Literal[...]` tag.

#### Scenario: Malformed layer yields a single-member error
- GIVEN a layer object missing required fields for both variants
- WHEN the manifest is parsed
- THEN validation MUST report exactly one error scoped to the tagged `type`,
  not ambiguous errors against both variants

### Requirement: Manifest hash is computed from the in-memory model

The manifest hash used as `Lockfile.generated_from` MUST be `sha256` over
`model_dump_json(exclude_none=False)` with sorted keys of the parsed `Manifest`
object. It MUST NOT read or hash raw file bytes.

#### Scenario: Semantically identical YAML, different formatting, same hash
- GIVEN two `project.yaml` files that parse to an equal `Manifest` but differ
  in whitespace/key order
- WHEN each is hashed
- THEN both hashes are identical

## Capability: onion-composition (New)

### Requirement: Compose orders and validates without materializing

`compose(manifest) -> list[Layer]` MUST order layers core-first,
client-last, and MUST validate: edition coherence (above), every
`Override.layer` reference exists in `layers`, and the client is the final
writable layer. It MUST perform zero filesystem or network access.

#### Scenario: Override referencing a missing layer fails
- GIVEN an `Override` naming a layer not present in `manifest.layers`
- WHEN `compose()` runs
- THEN it raises `CompositionError` and performs no I/O

#### Scenario: odoo-idp fire test composes cleanly
- GIVEN a fixture manifest expressing odoo-idp (core odoo/odoo@19.0,
  enterprise layer, localization layer with ~17 ingadhoc repos including
  `odoo-argentina-ee` at `requires_edition: enterprise`, edition: enterprise)
- WHEN `compose()` runs
- THEN it returns an ordered layer chain with no errors

## Capability: drift-detection (New)

### Requirement: detect_drift is a pure three-input function

`detect_drift(manifest, lock, materialized)` MUST accept already-loaded
in-memory models, perform no disk reads, and return a `DriftReport` covering
manifest↔lock hash drift and lock↔state drift independently.

#### Scenario: Clean state
- GIVEN a lock whose `generated_from` matches the manifest hash and state
  matching lock-declared commits
- WHEN `detect_drift` runs
- THEN `DriftReport.is_clean` is `True`

#### Scenario: Manifest changed, lock stale
- GIVEN a lock hash that does not match the current manifest hash
- WHEN `detect_drift` runs
- THEN `manifest_lock_drift` is non-empty and `is_clean` is `False`

## Capability: forge-validate-cli (New)

### Requirement: forge validate delegates all logic to the core

`forge validate [--manifest project.yaml]` MUST parse and validate the
manifest, run `compose()`, and report drift when a `project.lock` exists. All
decision logic MUST live in `odoo_forge`; the CLI only orchestrates and
prints.

#### Scenario: Malformed manifest reports a clear error
- GIVEN an invalid `project.yaml`
- WHEN `forge validate` runs
- THEN it exits non-zero with a single-cause, human-readable error

## Capability: source-provider-port (New)

### Requirement: SourceProvider is an interface with no implementation

`ports/source_provider.py` MUST define a `Protocol`/`ABC` with no adapter in
this slice; `odoo_forge` MUST depend only on the interface.

#### Scenario: import-linter enforces purity
- GIVEN the CI import-linter contract forbidding `docker, boto3, kubernetes,
  git, typer, subprocess` in `odoo_forge`, and forbidding `odoo_forge_cli`
- WHEN CI runs
- THEN the contract passes with zero violations
